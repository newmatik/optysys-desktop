/*
This is a Visual Studio Code `extensions.json` file. It's used to recommend extensions to the user of this workspace.

The "recommendations" array lists the extensions that are recommended for this workspace. Each item is the identifier 
of an extension, which typically takes the form of `${publisher}.${name}`. For example, "github.copilot" is the 
identifier for the GitHub Copilot extension.

When a user opens this workspace in VS Code, they will be prompted to install these extensions if they are not already installed.

This is particularly useful for sharing project-specific extensions with your team. For example, if your project uses a 
specific linter or formatter, you can add it to the "recommendations" array to ensure that everyone on your team has it installed.
