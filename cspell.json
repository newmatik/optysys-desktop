This is a configuration file for cSpell, a spell checker for code.
It's used to customize the behavior of cSpell to suit the needs of this project.

- "version": The version of cSpell configuration.
- "language": The default language used for spell checking.
- "dictionaries": A list of dictionaries to use for spell checking.
- "ignorePaths": A list of paths for cSpell to ignore. Useful for excluding directories like "node_modules".
- "words": A list of words to be added to the project dictionary. These words won't be flagged as spelling errors.

To use this configuration, cSpell must be installed and run in the environment where your code resides. 
For example, if you're using VS Code, you can install the cSpell extension and it will automatically use this configuration.
